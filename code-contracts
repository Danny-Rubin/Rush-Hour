Here are function and object descriptions:


@function   "solve":
parameters: board_dict- a python dictionary where keys are cars and values are lists that represent coordinates.
            n - dimension of rush-hour board (integer)
            
returns:    string of solution instruction if found, else string "no solution found"


@function   "is_solved":
parameters: 
            board
            n - dimension of rush-hour board (integer)
returns:    boolean, true iff the red car has a clear path to exit
            

@function   "vacancy_mat":
parameters: board
            n - dimension of rush-hour board (integer)
returns:    list of lists of booleans where a true entry represents an occupied block ##perhaps change boolean to car id's



@object     "Car":
fields:     length (int)
            color (string)

@object     "Board":
fields:     board_dict- a python dictionary where keys are cars and values are lists that represent coordinates.
            prev_board (Board)
            prev_step (string)
            n - dimension of rush-hour board (integer)
            next_list (list of Boards)
            id (string)   ## needs further description and function
methods:    "get_path" - returns string
            "next_boards": 
            parameters: 
            self
            board_set- a python set of all boards that have been added to the game tree
            n - dimension of rush-hour board (integer)
            returns: list of all legal countinuiation boards that are not yet in "board_set"
