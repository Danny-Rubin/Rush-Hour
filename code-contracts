Here are function and object descriptions:


@function   "solve":    V
parameters: board_dict- a python dictionary where keys are cars and values are lists that represent coordinates.
            n - dimension of rush-hour board (integer)
            
returns:    string of solution instruction if found, else string "no solution found"


@function   "is_solved":
parameters: 
            board
            n - dimension of rush-hour board (integer)
returns:    boolean, true iff the red car has a clear path to exit
            


@object     "Car":
fields:     length (int)
            color (string)
            is_red (boolean)
            is_vertical (boolean)
            id (string)   ## needs further description
methods:    
@method     "color_code" - returns color code for car


@object     "Board":
fields:     board_dict- a python dictionary where keys are cars and values are lists that represent coordinates.
            prev_board (Board)
            prev_step (string)
            n - dimension of rush-hour board (integer)
            next_list (list of Boards)
            red_car_pos - position of the red car (tuple)
methods:    
@method     "get_path" - returns string
@method     "next_boards":

            parameters: board
            n - dimension of rush-hour board (integer)
            returns:    list of lists of booleans where a true entry represents an occupied block ##perhaps change boolean to car id's
@method     "get_id":
            parameters: self
            returns:    str that represents board state
